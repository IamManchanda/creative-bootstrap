You'll find this post in your `_posts` **directory**. Go ahead and edit it and **re-build** the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and **auto-regenerates** your site when a file is updated.

To **add new posts**, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
